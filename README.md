# Why the GPL 3.0 license?

This software solely provides code used within the Unity editor application.
It is therefore not being built into executables (known as 'builds') created
by the Unity editor application.

Thus, by merely using this software in your Unity project, the GPL license
does not affect or alter your right to distribute 'builds' of your project.
You do NOT have to publish your entire Unity project (source) itself under the
GPL license.

HOWEVER, it does require that any editor code (scripts) that use this software
be released under the GPL license but ONLY if you distribute said editor code.

Sharing the Unity project within your team / company is not distributing!
BUT if you were to create an editor tool that uses this software, and you were
to distribute that editor tool, you would have to distribute your editor tool
under the same GPL 3.0 license.

In essence, my motivation is this:

- I want to share my work, for free, in source form, to everyone's benefit.
- I want to discourage commercial editor tool developers from basing their
  work on this software for the simple reason that I may do so myself.
  (You cannot publish assets containing GPL licensed software on the Unity
  Asset Store. You can charge clients for any work you do with this software.)
- I want to encourage commercial software developers to obtain a more
  permissive license for this software, for example by purchasing rights to
  this software either via the Unity Asset Store or directly from me.
  This encouragement is mainly because the separation of editor vs runtime
  scripts can be somewhat fluid, and companies ought to to err on the safe
  side. Given how much work (aka 'money') this software can safe even a small
  team it is certainly worth to invest in it.

I sincerely hope you understand my reasons for applying the GPL 3.0 license.

Please contact me if you wish to license the software under different terms,
no matter your intention. Generally feel free to contact me if you have any
questions or feedback.

Thanks for your time and understanding!
